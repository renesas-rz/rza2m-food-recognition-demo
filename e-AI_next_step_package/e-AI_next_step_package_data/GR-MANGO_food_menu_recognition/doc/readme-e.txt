3. About Sample Code

  This sample code operates the following processing.

  (1) Application program [rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc]
    (i)  Decodes (decompress) JPEG and encodes (compress JPEG [decode_encode_sample.c]
    (ii) Decodes (decompress) JPEG and shows to the screen [decode_sample.c]
    At the end of the above execution, the screen of (ii) will remain displayed (infinite loop with while (1) ).

    The application program is executed by the loader program after performing the register setting processing of 
    the SPI multi I/O bus controller (SPIBSC) and the serial flash memory by the loader program.
    The loader program is stored in the following folder.
      [rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc\bootloader\rza2_qspi_flash_ddr_bootloader.elf]

    This loader program conforms to the specification of Macronix MX25L51245G. When using another serial flash memory, 
    change the source code of the loader program project [rza2m_sflash_boot_loader_gcc] that is included in 
    "RZ/A2M Group Example of Booting from Serial Flash Memory" application note according to the specifications of 
    the flash memory, and then generate the new load module. The project debug configuration uses the loader program
    after changing the file name of the generated load module to "rza2_qspi_flash_ddr_bootloader.elf".

   Refer to application notes for the details about the sample code. 


4. Operation Confirmation Conditions

  (1) Boot mode
    - Boot mode 3
      (Boot from serial flash memory 3.3V)
      * The program can not be operated if the boot mode except the above is specified.

  (2) Operating frequency
      The RZ/A2M clock pulse oscillator module is set to ensure that the RZ/A2M clocks on the CPU board
      board have the following frequencies:
      (The frequencies indicate the values in the state that the clock with 24MHz
      is input to the EXTAL pin in RZ/A2M clock mode 1.)
      - CPU clock (I clock)                 : 528MHz
      - Image processing clock (G clock)    : 264MHz
      - Internal bus clock (B clock)        : 132MHz
      - Peripheral clock1 (P1 clock)        :  66MHz
      - Peripheral clock0 (P0 clock)        :  33MHz
      - QSPI0_SPCLK                         :  66MHz
      - CKIO                                : 132MHz

  (3) Setting for asynchronous communication
      - Bit rate        : 115200 bps
      - Data bit        : 8 bits
      - Parity bit      : none
      - Stop bit        : 1 bit

  (4) Serial flash memory used
    - Manufacturer  : Macronix Inc.
    - Product No.   : MX25L51245G

  (5) Setting for cache
      Initial setting for the L1 and L2 caches is executed by the MMU. 
      Refer to the "RZ/A2M group Example of Initialization" application note about "Setting for MMU" for 
      the valid/invalid area of L1 and L2 caches.


5. Operational Procedure

  Use the following procedure to execute this sample code.

  (1) Setting for DIP switches and jumpers  
    Set the DIP switches and jumpers of the CPU board as follows.

     <<Setting for CPU board>>
      - SW1-1  : ON  (Disabled SSCG function)
        SW1-2  : OFF (Setting to clock mode 1(EXTAL input clock frequency : 20 to 24MHz))
        SW1-3  : ON  (MD_BOOT2 = L)
        SW1-4  : OFF (MD_BOOT1 = H)
        SW1-5  : OFF (MD_BOOT0 = H)
        SW1-6  : ON  (BSCANP normal mode (CoreSight debug mode))
        SW1-7  : ON  (CLKTEST OFF)
        SW1-8  : ON  (TESTMD OFF)
      - JP3 :   Open (Use USB ch 0 in the function mode (Not supply VBUS0 power))

    Set the DIP switches and jumpers of the SUB board as follows.

     <<Setting for SUB board>>
      - SW6-1  : OFF (Setting to use P9_[7:0], P8_[7:1], P2_2, P2_0, P1_3, P1_[1:0], P0_[6:0], P6_7, P6_5, P7_[1:0] and P7[5:3] 
                      as DRP, audio, UART, CAN and USB interface terminals respectively)
        SW6-2  : OFF (Setting to use P8_4, P8_[7:6], P6_4 and P9_[6:3] as audio interface terminals)
        SW6-3  : OFF (Setting to use P9_[1:0], P1_0 and P7_5 as UART and USB interface terminals respectively)
        SW6-4  : OFF (Setting to use P6_[3:1] and PE_[6:0] as CEU terminals)
        SW6-5  : OFF (Setting to use P3_[5:1], PH_5 and PK_[4:0] as FLCTL terminals)
        SW6-6  : ON  (Setting to use digital image signal input output connector (CN15))
        SW6-7  : ON  (Setting to use digital image signal input output connector (CN15))
        SW6-8  : OFF (NC)
        SW6-9  : OFF (P5_3 = "H")
        SW6-10 : OFF (PC_2 = "H")

      - JP1 : 2-JP2  (Setting to use PJ_1 as interrupt terminal for IRQ0 switch (SW3))

    Refer to the CPU board and the SUB board user's manual for more details about
    setting for the DIP switches and jumpers.

  (2) Setting up sample code
    Copy the directories of [rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc] to the e2 studio workspace directory
    in the host PC (eg: "C:\e2studio_Workspace_v770").

  (3) Activating integrated development environment
    Activate the integrated development environment e2 studio.

  (4) Building application program ([rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc] project)
    After importing [rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc] project by the e2 studio menu, build the project 
    and generate the executable file named as rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc.elf.

  (5) Connecting with emulator
    Connect the J-Link Base and the connector on the CPU board with JTAG cable. 
    When connecting you will require the conversion adapter "J-Link 19-pin Cortex-M Adapter" made by SEGGER.

  (6) Downloading sample code
    Select "Debug Configuration" by the e2 studio "Run" menu and open the "Debug Configurations" dialog box.
    Select "Renesas GDB Hardware Debugging" from the list and display the detail list.
    Select the debug configuration [rza2m_jpeg_codec_sample_freertos_gcc HardwareDebug] of the application program, 
    and download both the executable file of the application program generated in (4) and the loader program 
    to the serial flash memory by pressing the "Debug" button.

  (7) Executing sample code
    Press reset on the e2 studio menu bar to start the debug session and the "Resume" button to run the code,
    Application code will be run after the boot loader process completes.
